<h1>Lab 8</h1>

<p>
Store all of your files for this lab in a folder named "lab8". 
</p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>
Copy either your implementation or the solution to Deck.h and Deck.cpp from last lab to your lab8 folder.
</p>

<p>
Modify the Card class in Deck.h and Deck.cpp to implement the following signature:
</p>

<code>
class Card {
public:
	int rank;
	int suit;

	/* Initializes the rank and suit of this object to r and s, respectively */
	Card(int r, int s);

	/* Constructs the class from a string representing the abbreviated value of the card.
	 * For example "6H" means rank of 6 and suit of 3, "QS" means rank of 12 and suit of 4,
	 * "10D" means rank of 10 and suit of 2.
	 */
	Card(std::string str);

	/* Returns the abbreviated string representation of this Card in the same 
	 * format as described in the constructor
	 */
	std::string to_string() const;

	/* Returns true if the rank of this object is less than the rank of the 
	 * other object */
	bool operator&lt;(const Card&amp; other) const;
};
</code>


<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

<p>Use the Deck class from last lab and your modified Card class to complete this exercise.</p>

<p>
Create a program that determines the type of poker hand of 5 cards specified on the command-line. The hand will be specified by whitespace-delimited list of card abbreviations in argv[1]. Each card will be represented by up to three characters: the rank and the suit. Name the source ph.cpp and the program ph. For example, the following command would specify Queen of Hearts, 10 of Hearts, 7 of Clubs, 6 of Hearts, and 4 of Spades:
</p>

<code>
./ph "QH 10H 7C 6H 4S"
</code>

<p>
The result of your command for the above example would display:
</p>

<code>
Nothing
</code>

<p>
Here are the types of poker hands the program should determine (from best hand to worst):
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Straight flush: Five cards of sequential rank, all of the same suit</li>
	<li>Four of a kind: Four cards of the same rank and one card of a different rank</li>
	<li>Full house: Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank</li>
	<li>Flush: Five cards of the same suit, not of sequential rank</li>
	<li>Straight: Five cards of sequential rank, not all of the same suit</li>
	<li>Three of a kind: Three cards of one rank and two cards of two other ranks</li>
	<li>Two pair: Two cards of one rank, two cards of a second rank, and 1 card of a third rank</li>
	<li>One pair: Two cards of one rank and 3 cards of three other ranks</li>
	<li>Nothing: Five cards not all of sequential rank, not all of the same suit, and no repeated ranks. (A hand that doesn't fall into any of the above categories)</li>
</ul>
