<h1>Lab 6</h1>

<p>
Store all of your files for this lab in a folder named "lab6". 
</p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>
Create a slot machine game. The user will start off with 100 coins. The program should work according to this process:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>The user chooses to pay 1, 2, or 3 coins</li>
	<li>The slot machine spins. There are three reels that spin, each real can land on a number from 0 to 9.</li>
	<li>If all three reels land on the same number, the user wins coins equal to 300 multiplied by the number of coins they paid.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This process should repeat until the user chooses to quit or runs out of coins.
</p>

<p>
Name your source file "slots.cpp" and name your program "slots".
</p>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

<p>
Create a program that displays all the cards in a standard 52-card deck in a random order. The program should display each card on a seperate line in the form of "&lt;RANK&gt; of &lt;SUIT&gt;". For example, the first 5 lines of standard output might be:
</p>

<code>
8 of Spades
King of Diamonds
Ace of Hearts
3 of Hearts
4 of Diamonds
...
