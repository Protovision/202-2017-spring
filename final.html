<h1>Final Project</h1>

<p>
Store all of your files for this lab in a folder named "final". 
</p>

<p>
Create a poker solitaire game.
</p>

<p>
It is a single-player game played by dealing cards, one at a time, onto a 5x5 grid. When the grid is filled, your score will be the sum of the scores of the rows and columns. The score of a row or column depends on the poker hand that can be created from the 5 cards of that row/column. Once a card has been placed onto the grid, it cannot be moved.
</p>

<p>
Here are the poker hand types and the number of points they are worth:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Royal Flush (100 points): An ace-high straight flush (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10 all of the same suit)
	<li>Straight Flush (75 points): 5 cards of sequential rank, all of the same suit</li>
	<li>Four of a Kind (50 points): 4 cards of the same rank and 1 card of another rank</li>
	<li>Full House (25 points): 3 cards of the same rank and 2 cards of another 2nd rank.</li>
	<li>Flush (20 points): 5 cards of the same suit, not all of sequential rank</li>
	<li>Straight (15 points): 5 cards of sequential rank, not all of the same suit</li>
	<li>Three of a Kind (10 points): 3 cards of the same rank, 2 cards of 2 other different ranks</li>
	<li>Two pair (5 points): 2 cards of one rank, 2 cards of another 2nd rank, and 1 card of a 3rd rank</li>
	<li>One pair (2 points): 2 cards of one rank, and 3 cards of 3 other different ranks</li>
</ul>

<p>
Try playing <a href="http://justsolitaire.com/Poker_Solitaire/">poker solitaire online here</a> to get an idea of how it works.
</p>

<p>
Your program should meet these specifications:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Before the game begins, the program will ask the user for her name.</li>
	<li>A shuffled, 52-card deck should be used within the program</li>
	<li>Before each deal, the total score of the current user should be displayed and the grid should be displayed with it's rows and columns labeled.</li>
	<li>The cards on the grid should be shown as abbreviations ("KD" for King of Diamonds, "10H" for 10 of Hearts, "2C" for 2 of Clubs, etc.)</li>
	<li>The user should specify the coordinate of where to place the dealt card</li>
	<li>The current score should be updated when an entire row or column as been filled.</li>
	<li>At the end of the game, the top 3 high scores should be displayed as well as the users who attained those scores</li>
</ul>

<p>
You may name your source file(s) whatever you like, place the compiler command that you use into a script file named "build.sh"
</p>

<p>
An sh file contains Bash commands. Executing an sh file will execute all the Bash commands in that file, line by line. Here is an example of a possible build.sh script for this assignment:
</p>

<code>
#!/bin/bash
g++-5 -std=c++14 main.cpp Deck.cpp
</code>

<p>
The above build script will compile main.cpp and Deck.cpp to produce an executable file named a.out. To execute build.sh, it must be marked as executable itself. After creating build.sh, use the following command to mark build.sh as executable:
</p>

<code>
chmod +x build.sh
</code>

<p>
Now you may run build.sh in the current directory with the <tt>./build.sh</tt> command. Everytime you edit your source files, you may run <tt>./build.sh</tt> to recompile your source files. Having a build script not only relieves you of having to memorize or re-type the compilation command(s), but it makes it easier for other people to compile your project.
</p>

<p>
Hints:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>You may use code from solutions to the previous labs to help you store a deck of cards and determine poker hand types</li>
	<li>High scores should be stored in external files which can be loaded or saved using fstream</li>
	<li>A 2-dimensional vector or array can be used to store the 5x5 grid of cards</li>
</ul>
