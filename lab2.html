<h1>Lab 1</h1>

<p>
Store all of your files for this lab in a folder named "lab2". 
</p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>
Create a program that finds the median of the numbers coming from standard input. The median is the number in the middle-most position of a sequence of sorted numbers. Name your source file median.cpp and name your program median.
</p>

<p>
Big hint: Extract all numbers into a vector, then use the sort function from &lt;algorithm&gt; before finding the median.
</p>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

<p>
Create a program that calculates the standard deviation of a sequence of real numbers coming from standard input. The formula you should use is:

<p>
Name your source file stddev.cpp and name your program stddev. 
</p>

<h3>Exercise 3</h3>

<p>
Create a program that finds the statistical mode of numbers coming from standard input. Mode is defined as the number that occurs the most in a sequence. Name your source file mode.cpp and name your program mode.
</p>

<p>
Hint: This exercise is done easiest by using a map
</p>

<h3>Exercise 4</h3>

<p>
Create a program that reads exactly one line from standard input, the program's main function will return 0 if that line is a palindrome and non-zero otherwise. Name your source file palindrome.cpp and name your program palindome.
