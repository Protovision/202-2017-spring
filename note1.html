		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			Computer science is the study of computation. The applications of this study are frequently performed using a computer. There are many sub-branches of computer science; the objective of this course, Computer Science I, is to teach you the essential concepts of computer programming.
		</p>
		<p>
			Computer programming is the process of giving instructions for a computer to carry out. In one case, the computer could receive these instructions through user interaction, immediately decoding and executing each one before waiting for the next instruction to be input by the user. In the other case, the user encodes and prepares all the instructions in advance, saving them into a file to be executed at a later time. These two forms of computer programming are what determines the main classification of programming languages: interpreted programming languages and compiled programming languages. 
		</p>
		<h3>What is a programming language?</h3>
		<p>
			The phrase "programming language" adds a qualifier to the word "language", so it is a type of language. Unlike other languages, it is more restrained because it must be translatable into machine language. A programming language is the middle language between machine language and human language. It contains some elements of abstract human concepts but each one always within the contraints of logic. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many programming languages and each one adopts a set of programming paradigms (modes of thinking about and expressing the logic of a computer program). We will not have time to cover every programming language and paradigm so we will just use one relatively popular programming language: C++.
		</p>
		<h3>The tools of computer programming</h3>
		<p>
			It is a practical necessity to use computer programs to create computer programs. Every programmer should have at least a text editor and a compiler. These tools come in different brands and some of these brands are only available on particular types of computers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A programmer uses a text editor to produce source code. Source code is a set of program instructions expressed in a particular programming language. The text editor is used for editing and saving source code into a file. This file can then be processed and converted into a computer program by a compiler.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course creating a computer program is not enough, the program must be allowed to execute for it's full potential to be realized. The master program responsible for executing all other programs on your computer is known as the operating system. 
		</p>
		<h3>User interfaces</h3>
		<p>
			When a program executes, it may reveal itself through a user interface. A user interface enables the user to directly see and possibly interact with the program. The way a user interacts with a program determines the classification of the user interface. The two main classifications are: Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command-Line Interface (CLI).
		</p>
		<p>	
			A GUI may contain buttons, textboxes, images, and videos; Through a GUI, the program can receive instructions by the user clicking, scrolling, tapping, or sliding. A CLI, on the other hand, is retricted to line-by-line, textual instructions coming from the keyboard; the display of the interface will also be completely text based.
		</p>
		<p>
			All programs must have the same type of user interface as the one presented by the operating system. Most people use GUI operating systems and thus, any CLI-based program they wish to run must be emulated inside another GUI program known as a terminal emulator. The terminal emulator (or terminal) emulates something like another operating system inside a window. This operating system may have a different interface from that presented by the main operating system of the computer. In this course, we will use a terminal to execute a program known as a CLI shell, the CLI shell will allow us to enter instructions that do, among other things: manipulate files, compile CLI programs, and execute CLI programs.
