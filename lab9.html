<h1>Lab 9</h1>

<p>
Store all of your files for this lab in a folder named "lab9". 
</p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>
Create a program that requires two parameters from the command-line. Each parameter will be a string representing a poker hand. Your program will display the hand that is the higher-ranking of the two hands. Name your program higher and your source file higher.cpp
</p>

<p>
Your program should be runnable from the command-line with a command such as the following:
</p>

<code>
./higher "3D 3S 3C KS 2S" "6H 6D 6S QC 4S"
</code>

<p>
For the above command, your program would display:
</p>

<code>
6H 6D 6S QC 4S
</code>

<p>
Because the 2nd hand ranks higher than the first
</p>

<p>
Poker hands can rank differently even though they have the same name (such as 2 hands that fall under "Two Pair"), please see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands">this article</a> on how poker hands are categorized and ranked between each other.
