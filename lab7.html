<h1>Lab 7</h1>

<p>
Store all of your files for this lab in a folder named "lab7". 
</p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>
For this exercise you will recreate the program from lab 6 exercise 2 using classes.
</p>

<p>
Save the following source file as "main.cpp"
</p>

<code>
#include "Deck.h"
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	Deck deck;
	deck.shuffle();
	while (not deck.empty()) {
		cout &lt;&lt; deck.draw().to_string() &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
}
</code>

<p>
The code in main.cpp uses a custom type named Deck which was included from "Deck.h". "Deck.h" contains the following C++ declarations:
</p>

<code>
#ifndef DECK_H
#define DECK_H
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;random&gt;
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;

class Card {
public:
	int rank;
	int suit;
	std::string to_string() const;
};

class Deck {
private:
	std::vector&lt;Card&gt; cards;
	std::default_random_engine re;
public:
	Deck();
	void shuffle();
	void reset();
	Card draw();
	bool empty() const;
};

#endif
</code>

<p>
The type Deck represents a standard 52-card deck. It proffers five member functions:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>shuffle: Shuffles the cards within the Deck.</li>
	<li>reset: Resets the Deck to it's initial state, with all 52 cards present.</li>
	<li>draw: Removes the top card from the Deck and returns it from this function.</li>
	<li>empty: Returns true if there are no more cards in the deck (due to multiple calls to the draw function)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Internally, the deck uses a vector to store all of it's cards. It also stores a random engine for use by the shuffle member function. Each card is stored as type Card, defined by the Card class.
</p>

<p>
The Card class represents a card with 2 integers. These 2 integers indicate the rank and suit of the card. The rank member variable will be 2-10 if the rank of the card is 2-10, respectively. Ranks Jack, Queen, King, and Ace will be indicated by values 11, 12, 13, and 14 respectively. The suit member variable will have a range of 1-4 depending on if the suit of the card is Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, or Spades. The to_string member function of Card will return a string of the form "&lt;RANK&gt; of &lt;SUIT&gt;" representing the current rank and suit of the card.
</p>

<p>
Your job is to implement the functionality of the Deck and Card classes by creating Deck.cpp. The following is a template to Deck.cpp to help you get started:
</p>

<code>
#include "Deck.h"

std::string Card::to_string() const
{

}

Deck::Deck()
{

}

void Deck::shuffle()
{

}

void Deck::reset()
{

}

Card Deck::draw()
{

}

bool Deck::empty() const
{

}
</code>

<p>
Keep in mind that the code in Deck.cpp and Deck.h is not under the context of "<tt>using namespace std;</tt>", any use of standard library components requires that you prepend <tt>std::</tt> before it's identifier.
</p>

<p>
When you are finished coding, you should have four files: main.cpp, Deck.h, and Deck.cpp. To compile the whole program use the following Bash command:
</p>

<code>
g++-5 -std=c++14 -o shuffled main.cpp Deck.cpp
</code>

<p>
The above command will compile main.cpp and Deck.cpp to create the program named "shuffled".
</p>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

<p>
Create a program that deals 5 random cards from a 52-card deck and determines if the dealt cards belong to the following poker hand categories:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Four of a Kind: 4 cards of the same rank and 1 card of another rank</li>
	<li>Full house: 3 cards of one rank and 2 cards of another rank</li>
	<li>Three of a Kind: 3 cards of the same rank and 2 cards of 2 other ranks.</li>
	<li>Two pair: 2 cards of the same rank, 2 cards of another rank, and 1 card of a third rank</li>
	<li>One pair: 2 cards of the same rank, and 3 cards of 3 other ranks</li>
	<li>Nothing: None of the above categories</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are more poker hand categories which you may have to implement in another assignment.
</p>

<p>
You must use code declared in Deck.h and implemented by your Deck.cpp for this exercise. Name your source file containing your main function "ph.cpp" and name your program "ph". 
</p>

<p>
Hint: Create a map where each pair stores a unique rank and the number of times that rank occurs in the hand. You can also use the count_if function from &lt;algorithm&gt; to determine how many pairs or threes are in the set.
</p>
